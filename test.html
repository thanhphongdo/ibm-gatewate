<p>The Zoo of Extinct Animals ZZ 2
</p>
<p>1&copy; Learning A&ndash;Z  All rights reserved. www.readinga-z.com
</p>
<p>Focus Question:
How does Hazel&rsquo;s summer-internship experience change her?
</p>
<p>Book Summary
Text Type: Fiction / Science Fiction
</p>
<p>Hazel&rsquo;s summer internship at the Buckland Rare Animal Research Center seems to be the perfect 
fit for her. Once she arrives, however, Hazel quickly realizes this is not an ordinary zoo. In fact, the 
research center has been bringing extinct animals back to life, but at what cost? The Zoo of Extinct 
Animals presents a plotline that challenges both the protagonist and the readers to answer some 
difficult ethical questions. The book can also be used to teach students how to analyze plot for 
unusual story structures and the proper use of comparative and superlative adjectives.
The book and lesson are also available for levels Z and Z1.
</p>
<p>Guiding the Reading
Before Reading
Build Background
&bull;	 Write	the	words	high ground on the board and 
</p>
<p>read them aloud to students. Have students work 
in small groups to discuss the meaning of the words 
high ground. Point out that high ground refers 
to making a choice between right and wrong and 
choosing to do the right thing. Provide students 
with a sheet of lined paper and have them free 
write about an example of a time when they were 
faced with a situation where they chose to take 
the moral high ground. Have them consider why 
it might have been difficult to choose the high 
ground and the effects of their actions. Invite 
students to share their responses in small groups. 
Have volunteers offer their experiences to the class.
</p>
<p>Introduce the Book
&bull;	 Give	students	their	copy	of	The Zoo of Extinct 
</p>
<p>Animals.	Guide	them	to	the	front	and	back	covers	
and read the title. Have students discuss what they 
see on the covers. Encourage them to offer ideas  
as to what type of book it is (genre, text type,  
and so on) and what it might be about.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Show	students	the	title	page.	Discuss	the	
information on the page (title of book, authors&rsquo; 
names, illustrator&rsquo;s name).
</p>
<p>Introduce the Reading Strategy:  
Make, revise, and confirm predictions
Explain to students that engaged readers pause 
to make predictions about what will happen next 
in a story, on the basis of what they already know, 
what has already occurred in the story, and what the 
characters say and do. Provide each student with a 
blank sheet of paper and have them divide it into three 
sections. Have them labels the sections Predictions, 
Revise, Confirm. Write	the	headings	on	the	board.	
Have students preview the first few pages of the 
story to create predictions. Invite volunteers to share 
their predictions and record them on the board. Have 
students record their predictions on their paper. Point

</p>
<p>out that it is not important that students&rsquo; predictions 
are correct but rather that they are based in the 
evidence found in the story. Explain that as they read, 
they should pause to consider the predictions they 
have made and either revise or confirm them.
</p>
<p>Introduce the Comprehension Skill: Analyze	plot
&bull;	 Explain to students that most stories include elements 
</p>
<p>such	as	setting,	characters,	plot,	and	theme.	Write	
the phrase Elements of Plot on the board. Remind 
students that frequently the plot is composed of the 
events in the story and that each plot contains five 
elements: introduction, rising action, climax, falling 
action, and resolution. Record the plot elements on 
the board and define each one with students.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Draw	a	plot	diagram	on	the	board	and	explain	the	
plot diagram to students. Point out this story&rsquo;s plot 
has an unusual plot structure, and they should be 
thinking about how it compares to a traditional 
plot diagram as they read.
</p>
<p>Vocabulary
Have	students	turn	to	the	&ldquo;Words	to	Know&rdquo;	box	on	
the	copyright	page.	Discuss	each	word	with	students.	
Then, have students turn to the glossary on pages 23 
and 24. Explain that the glossary provides definitions 
for the vocabulary words in the book. Point out the use 
of each content word and academic vocabulary word in 
the book, and then use each word in a different model 
sentence. Have students work in groups to create 
posters for these words. Have them include on each 
poster the word and its part of speech, the definition, 
the word in an example sentence, and a picture 
illustrating the meaning of the word.
</p>
<p>Set the Purpose
&bull;	 Have	students	read	to	find	out	more	about	
</p>
<p>Buckland	Rare	Animal	Research	Center.	Write	the	
Focus Question on the board. Invite students to 
look for evidence in the book to support their 
answer to the question.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Have	students	make	a	small	question	mark	in	their	
book beside any word they do not understand or 
cannot pronounce. These can be addressed in a 
future discussion.
</p>
<p>During Reading
Text-Dependent Questions
As students read the book, monitor their understanding 
with the following questions. Encourage students to 
support their answers by citing evidence from the book.
&bull;	 Why was Hazel initially skeptical of her internship? 
</p>
<p>(level 1) page 3
&bull;	 How is Buckland Research Center bringing back 
</p>
<p>extinct animals? (level 1) page 4
&bull; Why does Hazel walk through a haze of wonder 
</p>
<p>as Jim gives her a tour of the complex? (level 2) 
multiple pages
</p>
<p>&bull; Why does Malcolm think there is something fishy 
going on? (level 1) page 7 
</p>
<p>&bull; What was odd about Dr. Z arriving with the man 
dressed in safari clothing? (level 2) pages 10 
through 11
</p>
<p>&bull; What did Hazel see when she was walking around 
at night? (level 2) pages 13 through 15
</p>
<p>&bull; How do the billionaires both help and hurt the 
Buckland Center? (level 3) multiple pages
</p>
<p>&bull; Why is Hazel faced with a challenging decision? 
(level 3) multiple pages
</p>
<p>Text Features: Illustrations
Explain that pictures, or illustrations, in a story 
provide important information for the reader. Point 
out that illustrations often tell the reader many things 
that are not written by the author. Reread page 5 
aloud as students follow along. Have them work in 
small groups to look at the illustration and discuss 
how it gives more information than is written by the 
author. Invite volunteers to share their discussions 
with the class. Repeat this process with several other 
illustrations in the story.
</p>
<p>Skill	Review
&bull;	 Model	for	students	how	to	revise	and	confirm	
</p>
<p>predictions when reading. Point out that it is not 
important that a prediction is accurate but rather 
that	it	is	based	on	the	details	of	the	story.	Discuss	
with students how pausing to make, revise, and 
confirm predictions helps readers to understand 
and enjoy the story.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Have	students	review	their	predictions	and	either	
revise or confirm each one. Invite students to 
work with a partner to share their predictions and 
whether or not they were confirmed. Have students 
share their discussions with the class.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Model	analyzing	plot.	 
Think-aloud: I know that the plot of a story is 
composed of the events that take place, and that 
it typically begins with an introduction where 
the characters and setting are identified. Since 
the characters and setting are introduced in 
pages 3 through 6, I can identify this as the plot&rsquo;s 
introduction. As Hazel starts to ask questions about 
the research center, the rising action in the story  
is set in motion.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Have students work with a partner to identify  
on what pages the rising action occurs. Invite  
them to share their findings with the class.
</p>
<p>After Reading
Ask students what words, if any, they marked in their 
book. Use this opportunity to model how they can read 
these words using decoding strategies and context clues.

<p>Skill	Review
Graphic	Organizer:	Analyze	plot
Discuss	with	students	the	ending	of	this	story.	
Introduce, explain, and have students complete the 
analyze plot worksheet. Invite students share their 
results with the rest of the class, and guide a class 
discussion on how this story compares to a  more 
typical plot structure. Explain to students that this  
story ends on a cliffhanger, meaning it does not 
provide falling action or a resolution. Have students 
predict how they think the climax would be resolved, 
and what the falling action and resolution would  
look like.

<p>Comprehension Extension
Discussion	cards covering comprehension skills and 
strategies not explicitly taught with the book are 
provided to be used for extension activities.
</p>
<p>Response to Focus Question
Have students cite specific evidence from the book 
to answer the Focus Question. (Answers will vary 
but should include the following: Hazel&rsquo;s internship 
changes her because she is faced with the reality 
that no matter what decision she makes about the 
Buckland Research Center, she will ultimately be 
hurting someone.)

Build Skills
Grammar and Mechanics:  
Comparative and superlative adjectives
&bull;	 Review	with	students	that	an	adjective describes 
</p>
<p>which one, how many, or what kind. Have students 
turn to page 3 and reread the fourth paragraph 
aloud as students follow along. Invite volunteers 
to identify the adjectives within the text (massive, 
ridiculous, and so on).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Explain	that	adjectives	can	be	used	when	
comparing two or more things. Hold up two pencils 
of different lengths and ask students to identify 
adjectives that describe each pencil, such as long, 
short, small, thin, thick, and so on. Next, have 
students use these adjectives to compare one pencil 
to another, for example: The yellow pencil is shorter 
than the blue pencil. Write	students&rsquo;	responses	on	
the board and underline the comparative adjectives 
such as shorter, longer, thicker, and so on.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Write	the	headings	Comparative Adjectives and 
Superlative Adjectives on the board. Record the 
comparative adjectives used to compare the pencils 
under the Comparative Adjective heading.	Discuss	
that when -er is added to an adjective, it is called 
the comparative form of an adjective. Point out 
that comparative adjectives compare two things.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Add a third pencil that is longer or shorter than 
the others. Ask students for examples of how to 
compare all three pencils, such as the blue pencil is 
the longest. Write	this	sentence	on	the	board	and	
underline the word longest. Discuss	how	adding	the	
suffix -est to the word long makes it the superlative 
form of the word. Record the word longest under 
the Superlative Adjectives heading. Explain that 
superlative adjectives compare two or more things. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Check for understanding: Have students work 
independently to identify objects in the classroom to 
compare. Have them use a blank sheet of paper to 
write one sentence using a comparative adjective and 
one sentence using a superlative adjective. Examples 
may include the height of students in the class, the 
distance of students&rsquo; desks to the door, and so on.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Independent practice: Introduce, explain, and 
have students complete the comparative-and-
superlative-adjectives worksheet. If time allows, 
discuss their answers.
</p>
<p>Word	Work:	Content vocabulary
&bull;	 Point	out	to	students	that	many	of	the	vocabulary	 
</p>
<p>words in the book address the secrecy of the 
Buckland	Rare	Animal	Research	Center.	Write	the	
following words on the board: conservation, high 
ground, compound, violating, and protest.	Discuss	
with students a brief definition of each word.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Write	each	vocabulary	word	on	a	piece	of	paper	and	
place	the	papers	into	a	hat.	Divide	the	class	into	six	
groups and have each group choose a word from 
the hat; ask them to keep their word secret from the 
other groups. Instruct each group to locate the word 
in the glossary and then to read the word within the 
context of the story.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Explain	to	students	that	they	will	be	playing	
vocabulary charades and that each group must work 
together to silently enact their chosen vocabulary 
word for the class. Provide students with time to 
prepare for charades. Invite each group to the front 
of the room to share their nonverbal skit.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Check for understanding: Have students work in pairs 
to create oral sentences using the vocabulary words 
listed on the board. Have students give a thumbs-up 
signal if their partner used the word correctly.
</p>
<p>&bull; Independent practice: Introduce, explain, and 
have students complete  the content vocabulary 
worksheet. If time allows, discuss their answers.
